## completeness
80%. Didn't realize some function and have some bug.

## coding quality
90%. quiet clean, but with bug

## correctness
Some bugs exist. eg.  
input (99) -> (-) -> (9) -> (=) -> (+) -> (3) -> (=)  
output = 3 (should be 93)    

## things worth learning
1. Only use one state to realize the function. Very elegant.

## some points to improve
1. press '=' after '=' should run the previous operation again.

## other comments
1. npm test can't run
