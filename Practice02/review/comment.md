# Practice 02 Review
### 完程度(0~100%)

##### baseline (100%)

* I think all is done. 

##### Other Feature

* background image.
* characters' name.
* fake initial loading.
* text hint when mouse hover.

### coding quality(自由作答)

* I can see that you're not the novice in coding -- not hard-coded image name and using prefix name for folder.
* I don't know the timing you use `let` & `var`. It's kindof strange.
* `previousImage` & `nextImage` have some duplicate code.

### 正確性

* I think we should implement loading image  if given url -- not simulate the network delay is 200ms.
* Good usage in querySelector. I only use getElementById in this practice XD.

### 值得學習的地方

* Non-plaincolor background influence the viewer significantly, I think.
* We often said that first impression is important. Now I know why. Even we all know it's just a gif and the loading is fake. 
* Some tiny details I forgot to do, and this gut completely did.

### 建議改進的地方

* You are doing the theme about spongebob squarepants! So I think the default background can switch to the place where they lived.

* I see you paid a lot of time to decorate your html. How about font? Here's SpongeBob's default fonts: https://www.1001fonts.com/some-time-later-font.html. (The font in title is not suitible for you website.)

* Because the background is colorful. I notice the loading gif has some white edge in border. I think you can just change the loading gif that it's backgrounds remove completely.

* I think you can use some meme in spongebob when loading. XD
